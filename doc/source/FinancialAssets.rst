Financial asset and liability value
====================================

What is considered a financial asset/liability
----------------------------------------------

In business there are several ways to finance assets and other things your company needs. These ways of finance need to be compared and reported upon. The finance tools are also themselves assets or liabilities, creating a kind of "recursive asset".

"Compared" because choosing the wrong financial instrument may lead to paying to much and loosing opportunities. "Reported" because the cost of finance are of course part of the financial situation of the company.

Below I discuss some kinds of financial assets and liabilities. These discussions are not going tot "the bottom of it", they are meant to identify some fields of calculations that we need to address.

A loan
------

In a loan you take out some money from the lender and pay the lender a fee for the use of the money: the interest. The liability consists of the part of the capital still outstanding (i.e. actually the repayments) and the interest due in the future.

The repayments on the capital are scheduled for a normal loan. It may be scheduled as "repay everything at end", but these loans are considered risky and discouraged by regulatory rules. So we will consider loan repayments at a regular interval, with a repayment of the remainder at the last payment. Future payments will not be discounted by the interest rate.

Interest is accounted for in a given period in the future also. Amounts are not discounted. We will not assume that the interest schedule is the same as the repayment schedule, though in practice they usually will be.

Interest for the remainder (future) part of a period will be calculated at a fixed interest rate or interest rates determined outside of the calculation. 

A deposit
---------

The deposit is kind of the mirror image of the loan. It supplies an income stream for the capital and interest.

The repayment will be governed by a schedule and the calculation if the value of future repayments will be by discounting by the interest rate for funds due at the repayment time. Interest will be the same. Here also, repayment schedule and interest schedule may differ.

Other than for loans, there is a debtor risk being run. You are not sure the debtor will pay in time or will pay *at all*. This risk will be ignored for now. It does have an influence on the valuation of the deposit.
