""" This module contains classes for monetary calculations for interest.

The interest calculations are done for periods of days, for calendar periods
and for the period between two dates. 

Remarks:

*   For a period calculation a calculation/capitalization period needs to be
    passed down. The calculation period can not differ from the capitalization
    period
*   the calculation period can be "real" days, "real" days ignoring leap days
    (a year is considered to always have 365 days) or years having 360 days
    with months of 30 days.

The amount over the period need not be the same.

class Interest(object):
    """ Class to handle interest calculations

    The methods of this class are methods that return a value and those that
    set up a value in the class of the present calculation. The routines
    returning a value are in the class because they logically are used
    in interest calculations. E.g. calc_month is used to calculate  interest
    over full months.
