The IFRS rule 9 gives 2 options for the calculation, the rule to always
use the original and/or latest recognition, or to determine the fair value
based on the expected return. The latter one is for financial institutions,

individual instrument calculation to see how this pans out for the different

    """The class holds the liability value for one or more periods.

    From the input that is very similar to the interest calculation
    input the totals are calculated. It can also be used to project
    a value for a future period.

    The input is a period list, with each period a history period or
    a future period. History periods are formatted:

        :from_date: The start date of this period
        :to_date: The day after the end of the period
        :principal: The amount of the principal in the smallest denomination (like cents or pennies)
        :interest_posted: The interest posted in the period

    Future periods are formatted:

        :from_date: The start date of this period
        :to_date: The day after the end of the period
        :start_balance: The amount of the principal at start of the period in the smallest denomination (like cents or pennies)
        :interest_frac: The interest percentage as a fraction in the period

    For discounting you can enter discount factors. The factors are defined as:

        :date_factor: The date for which the factor is valid
        :factor: A fraction with which an amount is to be discounted on that date

    You can pass in None, than there will be no discounting of future amounts.
    If there is one factor, it will be taken as a constant, and each amount
    to be received after the date_factor will be discounted by the factor.
    You can pass in more factors, the factors will be interpolated between the
    dates and beyond the last date the factor will be constant (i.e. the value
    for the highest date). Before the lowest date, no discounting will be done.
