""" This module contains code to determine the value of financial instruments.

The IFRS rule 9 gives 2 options for the calculation, the rule to always
use the original and/or latest recognition, or to determine the fair value
based on the expected return. The latter one is for financial institutions,
so here we will always valuate on the latest recognition. See the 
individual instrument calculation to see how this pans out for the different
financial instruments.
