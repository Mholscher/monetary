The monetary library
====================

What is it for?
---------------

The monetary library is for editing and validating money amounts and doing basic calculations from the money domain.

It is for use with Python programs in the commercial and accounting domain. There are no scientific aspirations for the library.

It is developed using Python 3.9 (for now) and openSuse Linux. Python is a language that is compatible with most OSes, so it should also work in different environments. However, this was not checked, so YMMV.

How to get it
-------------

It is published using a Github repository where you can download it in the usual way (fork or clone).
